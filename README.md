  },




1. bcrypt:
   -  bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks. Commonly used in applications for securely hashing passwords before storing them in databases.

2. body-parser:
   -  body-parser is a middleware for Express.js that extracts the body portion of an incoming request and exposes it on req.body. Essential for parsing request bodies in POST and PUT requests in Express applications.

3. cors:
   -  cors is a middleware for Express.js that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing controlled access to resources located on other domains. Useful for allowing or restricting access to your API from different origins or domains.

4. dotenv:
   -  dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Commonly used in Node.js applications to manage configuration settings and sensitive information like API keys.

5. express:
   -  Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. Widely adopted for creating APIs and web applications due to its simplicity and flexibility.

6. gridfs-stream:
   -  gridfs-stream is a Node.js module that provides a stream-based API for working with MongoDB's GridFS, which is a specification for storing and retrieving large files in MongoDB. Useful for handling large files in MongoDB databases efficiently, such as images, videos, and other binary data.

7. jsonwebtoken:
   -  jsonwebtoken is a library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Node.js. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications, and this library simplifies their implementation.

8. mongodb:
   -  mongodb is the official MongoDB driver for Node.js, providing a high-level API for interacting with MongoDB databases. Enables Node.js applications to perform CRUD operations, data aggregation, and more on MongoDB databases.

9. mongoose:
   -  Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Simplifies interaction with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.

10. multer:
    -  multer is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is commonly used for uploading files in HTML forms. Allows Express.js applications to easily handle file uploads, storing them in the filesystem or another storage solution.

11. multer-gridfs-storage:
    -  multer-gridfs-storage is a GridFS storage engine for multer, allowing file uploads directly to MongoDB's GridFS using multer. Useful for storing uploaded files directly in MongoDB's GridFS, which can be advantageous for applications using MongoDB as the primary database and needing to manage large files.



These dependencies collectively provide a robust foundation for developing and optimizing your React website, encompassing styling, UI components, HTTP communication, project setup, and performance monitoring.
